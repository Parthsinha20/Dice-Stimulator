# Dice-Stimulator
A simple web application designed to mimic 
the rolling of a dice. The primary purpose of this project is to 
demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an 
interactive and visually appealing user experience. Users can click 
a button to "roll" the dice, and the application will display a 
random number between 1 and 6, simulating the outcome of a 
dice roll.
Technologies Used: 
HTML: Provides the structure of the web page, including buttons 
and display areas.
CSS: Styles the application to make it visually appealing, with 
custom designs for the dice and animations for rolling effects.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for generating random 
numbers, updating the display, and handling user interactions.
Features: 
Dice Display: The result of the roll is displayed on the screen, 
either as a number or as a graphical representation of a dice face.
Animations: CSS animations can enhance the user experience by 
showing a rolling effect when the dice is rolled
